Creating Secured REST APIs
Overview
REST APIs allow different systems to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Since these APIs handle data exchange, they must be secured to prevent unauthorized access.
Securing REST APIs
To protect APIs, we implement:
•	Authentication: Verifies the identity of the client.
•	Authorization: Ensures the client has permission to perform an action.
A common method for securing APIs is JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are digitally signed JSON objects used for:
•	Authentication: A client logs in and receives a token.
•	Authorization: The token is sent with every request for verification.
